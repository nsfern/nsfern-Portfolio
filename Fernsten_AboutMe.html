           Being a teacher has been my career choice ever since I was in elementary school. I have not decided what subject I am would like to teach yet, but I am leaning towards either English or history. I hope to attend Brigham Young University in Utah and gain a teaching credential at the David O. McKay School of Education in the Fall of 2020. I knew I wanted to be a teacher when I was younger because I had amazing teachers who I looked up to. They taught in a way that made me love coming to school everyday and learn as much as I could. I did not know what grade level I wanted to teach at the time, and it took me until high school to figure it out. I came to the realization that I wanted to teach either in middle school or high school, because the curriculum was much more challenging and the students are more mature.

	         One of my most prominent characteristics is empathy. I am able to notice other people’s needs and do whatever I can to help them. It is easy for me to sympathize with others and care for their needs. As class president for my Young Women’s class at church, I was able to use my empathy to look out for the girls in my class. I would often bake cookies for them or give them words of encouragement if I noticed they were going through a rough time. Being a teacher would require me to understand how the students are feeling and be able to sympathize with them. Another characteristic I have is patience, which is essential for being a teacher. Teachers have to deal with disruptive and rude students and keep a calm demeanor at the same time.

           On a few occasions when I have been babysitting, the kids have drawn on me, spilled food everywhere, or screamed incessantly. Although they tested my patience, I kept my composure by not having an angry outburst and instead calmly solve the issue at hand.

           I have been an active member of the California Scholarship Foundation since my second semester as a freshman. Through this club, I have volunteered for many different organizations within the Bay Area in order to help improve the community. For example, I have been to San Francisco on multiple occasions to serve meals to the homeless and I have volunteered at a charity bike race event. I have also been a member of the Plushies Aimed To Comfort Hearts club since my freshman year. I have had the opportunity to participate in volleyball for three years and basketball for one year at Dublin High School. I learned teamwork, cooperation, and unity with these teams. I have also worked as a student cafeteria worker at Dublin High School. Working there has taught me how to work quickly and efficiently under pressure as well as adapt to working with new people. My most notable accomplishment in high school has been maintaining a 4.0 or above GPA for all of my high school career while balancing my studies with sports.

           My time at Dublin High School has been some of the best years of my life and I am so grateful for all of the amazing friends I have made and the teachers who have helped me achieve my academic goals.  I have learned how to have a strong work ethic and efficient study habits that I will use in college and in future jobs. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Please continue to browse through the rest of my website for more information about me.

           <strong>Update: </strong>Now that school has officially been cancelled for the rest of the year, I have been trying to come to terms with missing out on what would have been my last few months at Dublin High School. I will not get to see my peers, friends, or teachers again in a school setting. I also will miss a lot of my senior class activities that I was looking forward to this year. Despite all of this, I have been trying to find ways to stay connected with people. One thing I have taken up again is baking, which I love to do but never had time during the school year. The best thing I have done during this lockdown was delivering cookies to almost twenty of my close friends and family. Although I could not greet them up close, it meant a lot to me to see the smiles on their faces. I hope to find other ways to be impactful to others while still staying safe, and I cannot wait for life to go back to the way it was.

           I have recently committed to Brigham Young University in Utah, and I plan to attend there in the Fall. I have not chosen a major yet, because I want to experience different types of classes before I make a final decision. I will probably major in either early childhood education or history. I have been able to connect with the new freshman class already, and I have virtually met my future roommate.
