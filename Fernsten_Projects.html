        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Spaceship Shenanigans
        <br>
        <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles

        <strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 1 week (September 2019)
        <br>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> Let the astronauts into the spaceship but donâ€™t let any space junk/aliens in before the astronaut runs out of oxygen (10 seconds to reach the spaceship)

        For the Scratch project, we were tasked with creating an interactive game that had multiple levels of difficulty and degrees of progress. We decided to make our game about an astronaut trying to reach his spaceship safely without touching any aliens or space junk. We created three levels that got progressively more difficult as they advanced. The user only is able to win the game is they pass all three levels at once. In the first level the astronaut has to move around the space junk to get to the ship. In the second level the astronaut has to move around the giant space cat to get to the ship, and in the third level he has to move around aliens to get to the ship. The user only has ten seconds for the astronaut to reach the spaceship until his oxygen runs out. If the user beat all three levels, then they would be directed to the winning screen. If they lost on any of the levels then they would be directed to the losing screen. My partner was in charge of the programming for the game, and I was in charge of the project documentation. At one point in the project, we did not know how to create a time limit for each level, but after working together, we were able to solve the problem together. As this was my first project on Scratch, I was not as familiar with the layout, so my partner was able to walk me through everything he did and I learned a lot about Scratch.

        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Escape Room Challenge Project
        <br>
        <strong>Course:</strong> Computer Science Principles
        <br>
        <strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 1 week (January 2020)
        <br>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> A bomb has been planted in a local high school. A note was left next to the bomb that said if school was evacuated then the bomb would explode. The problem is, they plan to blow up the bomb when the final bell rings if the evacuation does not occur. Your objective is to use the tools placed before you to defuse the bomb, but choose wisely. One mistake and the bomb explodes. Time is running out, and you are this school is last hope. You must defuse the bomb before the school gets out for the day.

        For the Escape Room Challenge, we had to create a interactive escape room with a unique theme and multiple challenges. We decided to make our escape room theme about a school that had a bomb somewhere in it. We created three different challenges that the user had to go through in order to successfully defuse the bomb. Before starting the challenge, the user is asked to input their name. Then they must answer yes or no if they will help save the school. If they say yes, they will start the game. In order to save the school, the user has to complete all three challenges at one time. In the first challenge, the user must choose between using a wrench or hammer. In the second challenge, the user must choose between a green or yellow button. In the third challenge, the user has to either cut the red or blue wire. If the user completes all of the levels, then they will have a message appear that tells them congratualtions for saving the school. Otherwise, a message will pop up telling them they were unsuccsessful and the school blew up. My partner was in charge of the documentation, and I was in charge of the programming for this project. For a while, neither of us knew where to begin, but after asking other people around us we were able to figure out the coding. Although we had a rocky start, the rest of the project went very well and my parter and I worked efficiently and we got the project done. Also, my partner was able to help me on some of the coding aspects that I did not know about, which was very helpful for my learning about Repl.it.
